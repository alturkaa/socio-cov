## Repository for COVID-19 Data Dashboard

Code in this repository is for an interactive [dashboard](https://socio-covid.netlify.com/) of various COVID-19 data, including social determinants of health, at the county level in the United States. 

The code for all pages of the website is in the index.Rmd file. 

For more about how to create a similar dashboard in R, check out [flexdashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html).

Thanks to Drew Keener and John Little at Duke's [Center for Data and Visualization Sciences](https://library.duke.edu/about/directory/dept/center-for-data-and-visualization-sciences) for great tutorials on mapping in R and working with flexdashboard. John's flexdashboard material can be found [here](https://github.com/libjohn/workshop_flexdashboards).
